# Yarnberry [Zero-Installs](https://v3.yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) Integration Test

This integration test case showcases Yarnberry's zero-installs feature, enabling dependency management without the need to install packages locally.

Combination of [Plug'n'Play](https://v3.yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) and [Offline Cache](https://v3.yarnpkg.com/features/offline-cache).
Each time a package is downloaded from a remote location a copy will be stored within the cache. By default, it is `.yarn/cache` directory.
There is no need to run `yarn install`.
